                    <p class="interestContent"> Thanks to my brother who was always introducing me to new artists, and always promoted discovery without discrimination when I was younger,
                        <br>I've developped a true passion for music in general.
                        <br>
                        <br>In my early teenage years, I got an intense urge to create it. And after a couple months ,I managed to convince my parents to buy me my first instrument
                        <br>A very cheap, and awful to play acoustic guitar that I loved very much.
                    </p> <div id="imageInterest"></div></div>
                <div id = "interest2"><p class="interestTitle">Music Production</p>
                    <p class="interestContent">Ever since i got my first guitar, I've always wanted to create and record my own music,
                        and with studios being completly out of my reach, I went to the next best thing:
                        <br>doing it all by myself and recording everything using free software and my phone's microphone.
                        <br>
                        <br>I have since moved on to more professional software like ableton but I still remember the struggle I went through just to create a couple cool sounds and scream my feelings out.

                    </p></div>
                <div id = "interest3"><p class="interestTitle">Computer Science</p>
                    <p class="interestContent">I've always found computers interesting whilst growing up,
                        <br> whether it was the inner workings of video game engines, or in more recent years, the way these modern machines are built.
                        <br>I remember always being considered the tech kid that others could ask for help.
                        <br><br>Needless to say, I don't think I've surprised anyone with my study choices.</p> </div>
                <div id = "interest4"><p class="interestTitle">Visual Arts</p>
                    <p class="interestContent">The most common and most appreciated category of art.
                        <br>It is also the most inclusive one, with artists ranging from Da Vinci to Andy Warhol and finally to your younger sibling.
                        <br><br>Anyone can do visual art, and we've all been doing it on the margin of our papers for years.
