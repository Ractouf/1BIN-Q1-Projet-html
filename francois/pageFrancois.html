                        <p class = "textHobby">During a scouting event called the "24 hours of cycling", I discovered the pleasure of cycling. I quickly bought a road bike and started riding on the flat roads of Belgium. A few months later I joined a club that allowed me to improve even more!</p>
                        <p class = "textHobby">In my family music is quite important, my parents enrolled me in a music academy at a fairly young age, and then I took guitar lessons. I did 10 years of guitar, which means that I have the level of conservatory. Unfortunately, I had to stop once I got this level because the work became too heavy.</p>
                        <p class = "textHobby">Thanks to my parents who enrolled me in the academy I also developed a passion for sound, I hesitated to study sound engineering but my preference went to computer science.
                            When I watch a movie, I think more about the technical aspect than the story itself.</p>
                        <p class = "textHobby">Like music, scouting is something I've done since I was a kid. Scouting has given me so much knowledge and good times. Knowing how to build a house out of logs seems impossible until you do it.</p>
